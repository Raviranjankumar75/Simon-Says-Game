# About the game

Simon Says is a classic memory and reaction game where one player (the leader) gives commands to others, starting with "Simon says." Players must only follow the command if it begins with "Simon says." If the leader gives a command without saying "Simon says" and a player follows it, they are out of the game. The game continues until one player remains or the leader decides to stop. It helps improve listening skills, concentration, and quick thinking.
